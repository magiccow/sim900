# sim900-gsm

Sample code for PC application receiving SMS via serial-attached SIM 900 GSM Module.  (read-sms.py)
Repo also contains send-sms.py which uses cloud service Nexmo/Vonage to send test text messages 
module. This is derived from the Nexmo sample code; don't forget to pip3 install nexmo, and also put
your own Nexmo keys into sms.ini. 

read-sms.py uses Python3 and serial library, so should work on RaspPi also.
